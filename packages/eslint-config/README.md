# @trajano/eslint-config

Single place where all the ESLint configuration is performed.

Prettier is defined here but there is no configuration, the intent is to let prettier run as it's defaults as much as possible.

## Usage

In package.json

```json
"eslintConfig": {
  "extends": [
    "@trajano"
  ]
},
```
