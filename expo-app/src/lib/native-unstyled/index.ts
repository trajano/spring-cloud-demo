/**
 * This library provides i18n and themeing logic for React Native.
 * It is called unstyled as there are actually no components that
 * are styled to look nice.  They are left as close to the default
 * as possible.
 *
 * What it provides are wrappers to the React Native core components
 * that give extra props for i18n, themeing and utility.
